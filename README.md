### Andon Monitor System
Andon Monitor System is a web application that displays real-time data on production line status, which is commonly used in manufacturing environments. The system allows for quick identification of production issues and provides the necessary information to resolve them efficiently. The data is stored into a database which is pulled using a query and requests module. This data is then transformed into a format that can be read, and exported to an excel file.
